## Preface: I will be joining Daniel Pledger on his idea for a tower defense game.

## The Idea and Target Audience
The project will be making a game on ios that involves professors trying to stop students from getting to Min Khao. Since it will be for ios this would reach a large population of consumers. With the mobile market being the largest gaming market in the world it would stand to reason that a mobile app would be the best way to reach the most consumers, although this will hopefully be compatible not just ios mobile but also on macOS. 

## Platform and Experience
I personally don't have any experience programming on Mac, but there should be a way to create a virtual macOS on pc in order to test and compile the program. I have plenty of experience playing games at a competitive level so hopefully I'll be able to use that experience to
make the game both fun, yet difficult while making the user interface user friendly both through simplicity and explicit information i.e. giving actual stats and percentages to upgrades (in issue in many mobile games, let alone PC giants such as FFXIV and WoW). 

## Features
Some of the major features of this game would be:
	- A game similar to bloons tower defense.
	- A clean and adaptable menus that are not too complicated but still packed with information.
	- Cute character sprites and a progression system in order to maintain player interest.
	- If time permits a way to create procedurally generated levels.
	- A barebones login system that could (if funded obviously) later be used to track progress server side so the game can be played on multiple devices or if the game is deleted and reinstalled.
