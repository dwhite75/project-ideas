# Project Proposal

## Brief Summary
The idea of this project is to be a cooking helper app that can provide some tools to make cooking easier. It would be similiar to a note taking app with some extra additions.

## Problem Being Solved
Sometimes cooking can be annoying. Multitasking can be confusing and having to figure out proportions can be a burden. This app would be able to provide an easy way to convert the proportions of ingredients needed while also adding checkpoints for what step you are on.

## Major Features
* Fields for entering in a recipe with the steps and ingredients.
* A converter for the amount of ingredients needed based off of how many people are being cooked for.
* A way to track what step you are on in the recipe.
* Storing saved recipes in a file for editing.
* Exporting to a printable file.
* Timers that can be added to steps.

## What Languages
Either:
* C/C++
* Python

## Who Would Buy
This app would be most helpful for home cooks or people learning to cook.
