# **My Idea:**

	UTK TD, University of Tennessee: Tower Defense, is an iOS tower defense type game made with Swift and SpriteKit.
This game is a simple and fun game that shows how students and vehicles traverse the UTK campus. This will assist
new students in familiarization with campus layout as well as entertain them in class!!! This game would be a free
app for students with various in-game microtransactions such as movement speed buffs for the pedestrians and vehicles
as well as upgrades for buildings and "professors" to thwart students from making it to their next classes. The scope
of neccessary technology for this project is unknown as this point. I'm almost certain that a MacOS or MacOS virtual
machine will be sufficient to create this application on. Getting the software onto the iPhone and running is a
worry, but I'm sure there will be many resources that will assist with this learning curve.
