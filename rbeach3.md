| Neural Networks |

Deep learning is a field of machine learning that is pretty fresh on
the world stage. The use of neural networks to solve problems has really
only started to make headway over the last 10ish years. During the Deep 
Learning class I took here we had looked over some research papers and I 
learned that the research being done really just involves the pairing of 
different layers of convolutional neural networks. So if you understand 
how those layers work, and how to code them from scratch, backpropogation
and all, you can find a way to be a part of a brand new field of study
which I believe will eventually be the core of all computing. 
It can be applied in natural language processing, visual recognition, medical 
image analysis, computer vision, etc. There is not necesarily a problem being 
solved here, but more laying a foundation to solve bigger problems in the 
future (if this is a route you wish to take). The features would be variable
layers and variable learning methods within the layers. 
It will be coded in python since I already have some code for it. I have the 
feed forward portion of the Convolutional Neural Net working. The 
backpropogation is the hard part (which I dont have). It is the reeeeeally hard part.
The end goal is to write the network so that it can read through a 
training set of faces and learn their age, sex, and race. Then run the 
test set to check for correctness. I have the test and training sets already
since we used them during a project we did with tensorflow. However getting 
it to learn on those faces with a hand build CNN should be a pretty hefty
challenge. Finally, this isn't necessarily something someone would buy or
use since these things are already in use. What I will say is having this
on your resume drastically separates you from others. Being able to 
work with and understand this is a massive step in a seriously cool 
direction and can help you quickly get involved in some bleeding-edge
research.
