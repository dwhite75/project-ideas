# Project Idea: Laundry Tracker

# By: Matt Duraney

## Summary

- The idea of my project is to create some kind of application that gives the user the
ability to track their laundry. This will easily allow someone to manage their own closet and
know exactly when they need to do their laundry. I personally find it easy to forget to do
laundry and keep track of what clothes I have so the main problem being solved is the problem
of keeping track of one's laundry. This will most likely be a web application, but definitely
open to possibly making it an iOS application as well. Lastly, the main users of this application
would be pretty much anybody in the general population who would like an easy way to manange their
closet and laundry.

## Major Features

- Ability to add/remove clothing items
- Receive notificaitons when it is time to do your laundry
- Easily enter used clothing items every day
- Customizable settings (notification settings, etc.)
- Insert a schedule so the app knows what clothes you need each day and can notify accordingly

## Languages and Tools

- Can be done using a wide range of languages and tools
- Possibly C++/Python
- Web/app development language/tool
