COSC 340 Assignment 2

	My project idea would be a google maps style application that could calculate walking routes based on the amount of time you want to be walking. While normal wayfinding apps will calculate the most efficient and quickest routes from one point to another. I would want this application to be able to take in the amount of time you have before your next appointment and calculate a route for you to walk to get there in time but not so early that you have to wait around. This would allow users to use their time taking a more scenic route, getting exercise, and not having to wait around in a building for their next arrangement. To build this I would have to use a map API for GPS tracking and would like to use pyQT for the GUI.
