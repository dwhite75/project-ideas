## Project Idea
This project intends to make an easier to use and better looking interface of NASA's exoplanet archives. Right now, the planets and their information or not all in one place. This makes it hard to search for planets with certain criteria. 

## Problem Solving
The main webpage would just be easier to use. We would do this by organizing the planets by certain criteria that you could set. By being able to sort and search based on the users needs, they will be able to find the necessary information easily and more quickly.

## Features
* Centralized Searching
  * Able to seach from one location
* Limited Search
  * Set options for search parameters
* Advanced Search
  * Sets as many options or parameters for searching
  * Most likely for professionals
* Old Search
  * Send them to old webpages that match their results

## Languages Needed
* Will most likely use Python or C++
* HTML and CSS for Webpage

## Intended Buyer
* NASA. This program would replace NASA's old and outdated looking webpage. Users are already able to use their program for free, so this program would also be free for users.
