## Additional Information
I am a fourth year student, in my third year of my CS major. Before switching to CS I was an aerospace major.
In my free time I like to play games, like Minecraft, Satisfactory, and [Blaseball](blaseball.com), and indulge in my game desgin obsession.
Most of my game desgin is done in Unity and C#, but I know C++ and some rudimentary C as well.
