# Movie Rating Database
A web app that compiles ratings from all the most popular movie rating sites and comes up with a composite score for each film
## Overview
As stated above, this project idea is for a website that lists popular movies and has a composite rating for each movie. Users would be able to browse through
lists of the highest rated films and also be able to search for films to find their ratings. 
## Problem Being Solved
When searching for a movie you want to watch, you can easily find all the ratings for the movie by a simple Google search. However, these ratings are all separate, and each 
website's rating system is different. This makes it difficult to decipher what the average consensus is for a movie. With a composite rating, finding out how good a movie is
would be much easier, since you would just need to go to one site to find out the rating, rather than having to figure out the general consensus on your own. 
## Features 
* Composite rating system that takes ratings from the largest movie rating websites such as Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and Metacritic, and runs them through an algorithm to
determine the movie's composite rating. 
* List of highest rated movies by their composite rating
* Search box that allows users to search for a film that they are trying to find the rating for
* An "audience" rating system that takes ratings from the users and develops an average audience score
## Languages Used
* React
* HTML/CSS 
* API to retrieve movie ratings from the review sites
* Possible C++ or Python to create an algorithm to determine the composite movie rating (could also be done in JavaScript)
## Target Audience
This project is targeting to anyone who enjoys watching movies and likes to know the rating for movies before or after they watch one. It could also be targeted at a younger 
audience by adding social features like the audience rating system.
