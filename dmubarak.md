Summary:

My idea for the project is to build a software/program that sports information can be organized with.
Coaches from different sports will be able to input information based on their team and an algorithm will help sort the information into different tables.


Reason to make this program:

My golf coach last year, from Tusculum University in Tennessee, said there is not a good program out there to organize sports information with and this idea will help that.


Major Features of program:

Some major features will be, an algorithm to sort data based on numbers or alphabetically, a saving system to keep information safe, 
and even a comparison tab to compare data from the past or against other teams.
There will also be some tabs to choose what sport to hold the information for and based on that sport, certain information can be inputted. For example, track and field can
input information based on 100m sprint times, or even long jump distances.Football coaches can input information based on rushing yards, penalties, quarterback sacks, etc.



Programming languages needed:

Some programming languages that might be used will be, Python, C++, HTML or even Java depending on what is needed.



Who is this program for:

This program will be designed to be used by coaches from college, high school or even in the professional league.
They will benefit greatly with a program that can organize that information and see how they stand against other teams or from past results.
