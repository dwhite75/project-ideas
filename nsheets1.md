# Project Idea: (Customized **Security System)**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Summary:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a world with an increasing amount of valuable items, there must be a way to keep our possessions protected. We now have the technology to make this a realistic possibility to implement. What if there were a way to integrate a custom security system to provide a connected protection support to an individual customer.

# Problem Description:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Break-ins to cars, storage sheds, and houses are increasingly more common. A lot of times there are not ways to receive instant feedback in a timely manner. This causes personal damage and loss that are unrecoverable to the owner.

# Major Features:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The solution would include a number of sensory systems (for as many places desired to protect - house, storage shed, car). A system would consist of an arduino board and a package of sensory items. These sensor packages would communicate to a raspberry pi if tripped. Then, the raspberry pi would be connected to a camera monitoring each system. The interface would provide notifications with informatics (regarding the location of the break-in, the picture/monitoring of the area that was broken into, and monitor the valuable items).

# Languages/Tool Sets:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We would use arduino boards and arduino IDE which runs C++ code. We would use Python on the raspberry pi. Additionally, there would be a web-based app/server or an application. This would potentially be done with Python via Flask or a Java or C\# application.

# Who Would Buy/Use:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyone wanting to protect their expensive items and want an easy use security system that can bundle monitoring of all their locations, and provide informatics as to the nature of the individual breach.
