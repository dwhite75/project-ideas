# Project Idea Resturant Automation
## Summary
The idea of the project is create a easy to use system for staff at a restaurant to better handle guests. Often times waiters may be taking orders on a piece of paper, or they may keep track of tables currently seated on a whiteboard. The created software can help get rid of these pen and paper methods to help the business keep track of daily sales and ease communication between staff members. At many restaurants managers have to report daily earnings by keeping track of the receipts. The software could keep a digital copy of every receipt to track sales. The product could have features for specific areas of the restaurant.
