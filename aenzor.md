###### Summary
An app or website that allows the user to learn common math rules and shortcuts quickly and efficiently. The main idea is for calculus but can be used for other areas of math as well.
###### Problem being solved
It should be simple problems that can be solved quickly to help the user quickly recognize which rules should be applied. Ideally the problems are dynamically generated. 
###### Features
Features would be the ability to select which rules you want to practice. And potentially start adding in different areas of math, such as trigonometry and algebra.
Could potentially be gamified in the future and even track user progress.
###### Languages
I have experience with Java, Java-script, php, and C++ so I would ultimately like to use one of these. But I am open to using any framework. 
###### Target Audience
The target audience is people in calculus who are struggling or who want to be faster. And if expanded it could be used by people wanting to practice multiple different areas of math.
