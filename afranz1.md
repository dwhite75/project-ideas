# Project Proposal

## Brief Summary
My idea for a project would be a recipe book of sorts.  An application that would store recipes and allow searching by fields other than dish names.  It would also need visuals and search fields that make it more pleasing to sort by and use in comparison to other methods like a folder full of Microsoft documents.  The application could also be used to calculate smaller or larger portions of the original recipes stored.

## Problem
What this would solve is making storing recipes on a computer easier to find and look through for specific recipes or finding recipes that fit a specified purpose.  It would also solve a problem for me personally, which I’ve found it’s difficult to cook a lot of recipes because they never seem to be in mind for a single person consuming them, and I hate wasting food.

## Major Features
Add/removal of recipes
Search fields for types of recipes, alphabetical sort, meal type, etc.
Scale portion size, fractions v. whole numbers for smaller/bigger sizes
Customization for viewing/graphics/color

## Using
- Unity
- C#
- C++

## Who Would Use
I would imagine anyone who prefers storing recipes digitally to good old-fashioned methods such as recipe cards or recipe books would be interested in an application that is easier to search for finding dish recipes without having specifics in mind.  It would also be of interest to anyone that commonly would like to or finds it necessary to modify the size/proportions of the recipes they make.
