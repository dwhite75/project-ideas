# **Project Idea**

I am interested in making music, so I would love to do a project involving audio.
My first thought was to make a VST instrument or effect. This is a plugin that could
be used in popular DAWs (Digital Audio Workstation) like Ableton, Logic, or GarageBand.

# Concept 

One of my favorite types of sound and timbre comes from granular synthesis. This works 
like sampling audio with varying grain sizes, which control the length of the sample. The
magic really comes in when effects are added to randomize, layer, or varying sample start
locations. If anyone is interested in a different audio project, I would also be open to
working on another type of synthesizer or audio effect. 

# Tools

- JUCE Framework. This is an open source cross-platform app framework commonly used to
develop plugins. Convieniently it is built in C++, so it should be easy for most of us to learn.

- C++

- Potentially we could have a webapp where the synth can be hosted
