# World of Code (WoC)

## What is WoC

[World of Code](https://worldofcode.org/)  is a research tool developed by Dr. Mockus and several undergrade and graduate researchers. 
By scrapping GitHub, developers are able to analyze the data allowing to receive valuable data within the open source community.

## Problem

Problem at hand is that coders may use a piece of code from the open-source community, and it may have vulnerabilities. 

# Problem Solution

The solution is to make a front-end portal within WoC that would allow a user to use a search bar to search for a vulnerablity. The results would contain if that vulnerablity has been fixed by the author and also give back a track record of those who may contain the vulnerablity in their code as well. 

## Tools Needed
  
  * React
  * JavaScript
  * HTML
  * CSS
  
## Who Would Buy/Use this Solution

This website and applications will be used by researchers, professors, and students that would like to have their code reviewed by certain vulnerabilities. Additionally, it will provide great amounts of information regarding who is utilizing a particular vulnerable file.
