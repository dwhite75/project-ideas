# Project Proposal
## Summary
We intend to build a software application that allows for a user to easily keep track of the foods they have currently. We are more specifically looking into applying this to refrigerators (smart fridges), but mostly as a web app, where we could scan receipts to apply it to the current inventory, and make an easy way to tell it you have run out of something. This app could then propose possible recipes for the user based on what they currently have.
## Features
    - A receipt scanner to update inventory
    - A tool that can present recipe options based on your current inventory
## Languages
We intend to make this cross platform, so the best way to go may be to make it work as an internet application instead of writing a specific app for iPhone or Android. I do not know immediately what language this will use, but we are in the process of figuring this out.
## End User
This would be applicable to the average family. The nice thing about creating an internet app instead of just running it on a smart fridge is that people do not have to have an expensive smart fridge to run it.
