# Robotics Club Website

### Overview
Our university's VEX robotics team (which I am a member of) is currently in need of a formal website for recruiting and sponsorship purposes. This project will be building that as well as adding some helpful features that we may need later on.

### Problem
- Our robotics team needs more members and funding.
- In order to secure these things we need a public frontend such as a website.
- We would like to be able to easily view information about the team such as event schedule and competition data.

### Project Features
- Pages with information such as the calendar, about us, contact, etc.
- Ability to leave a message that is delivered via email.
- Web scraping which will pull our competition statistics from robot events and give us a few useful stats

###Languages/Frameworks
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Python
- Node JS

### Who Would Use It
- Team Members
- Potential Recruits 
- Sponsors
- Other Teams That Want to Use Our Informatics
