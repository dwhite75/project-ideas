# Pantry / Meal Prep Tracker
------------------------------
This application is meant to serve as a pantry food and ingredient tracker with an integrated meal
prep recipe book. The user will be able to add or remove ingredients from the pantry manually or scan
a reciept and import items automatically. The recipe book will suggest meals based on whether or not you have the necessary
ingredients to make it. Finally, the application will feature an option to make a shopping list based on recipies, then update
the pantry quantities once they have been acquired to make inventory more streamlined.
