Brief summary of the project idea:
  
  The app would compile restaurant and store open hours as well other data about the locations. It would then allow you to use sorting and filters to find what you want. The data would range from business hours to ability to deliver and distance from your location.

What problem is being solved:
  
  With Covid, many business hours and functions of retail and restaurant locations have been disrupted greatly. To have an app that would compile all these attributes for you and then allow you to further search, filter, and sort would be rather handy.

List of some of the major features:
- Ability to filter locations
  - by business hours/open status
  - location type
  - ability to deliver
  - etc
- Display info on the location including:
  - Phone number
  - Website
  - Schedule
  - etc
- Basically like google's search engine, but focused on retail & restaurants in app-form

What languages, tool sets, third-party code, etc you plan to use:
- Python as main language
  - Usage of its many APIs, especially web-based ones to acquire info from Google

Who would buy/use this solution:
  
  Hopefully, this could be an app most anyone could use, in particular, this could be helpful to people who are unfamiliar with their surrounding location.
