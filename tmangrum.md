# Reading Tracker App 
## Project Overview
The idea for this project is to create a cross-platform mobile application that users can use to keep track of books that they have read and statistics about their reading sessions.
## Problems Being Solved
* Getting into the habit of reading can be difficult. This application would help develop that habit by giving you a way to track your reading sessions over time.
* Reading effectively is a difficult skill to master. This application will help users get more out of their reading by forcing them to summarize what they just read to help with retention.

## Major Features
* Users will be able to create reading sessions, which keep track of how long a user has been reading. At the end of each session, the user will be presented with a text window to summarize what they just read, and enter the number of pages read. This summary will be stored with the reading session and users will be able to go back and view the sessions again. 
* Reading statistics, such as number of pages read, how many reading sessions, and hours read over a period of time will be displayed on the home page of the app. 
* Users will be able to enter ISBN numbers to add books to their collection. Information about the book will be fetched from the ISBN number. A stretch goal would be to use the camera to scan the ISBN number directly off the book
## Languages/Tools Used
* React Native
* API to fetch books based on ISBN number
* TypeScript
* MongoDB/Other database to store user info (unless device storage can be used) 
## Target Audience
The target audience for this application would be those who are interested in developing/improving a reading habit or want to keep track of information about the books they read.
