## Proposal

A platform for developers with similar goals and interests to meet one another.
Basically Tinder for programmers. (_that was a joke_)

## The Need

### Job Experience

One word of advice that beginner programmers often hear to improve their craft is to contribiute to open source projects. The problem with this advice is that, especially as a beginner, it can be very difficult to find an open source project that checks all the boxes.
- Are you capable of working on it?
- Is it interesting to you?
- Will it help develop your career/personal skillset?
With this platform, the goal is to answer those questions concisely and effectively.

### The Groundwork

Luckily, GitHub already has a massive foundation of repositories and developers to pull from. It is the largest collection of programmers to date, and with that collection comes the necessary infrastructure to service their needs (i.e. Github APIs) Using GitHub as a foundation will greatly ease the jumpstart.

## Features

- GitHub account linking
- An algorithm to match developers with projects that most closely suit their desire
- A data base for profiles, project preferences, and liked projects
- On-site embedded repo information to make browsing easier (no opening 1 million new tabs)
- A list of GitHub repositories matching the user's criteria
- _(optional)_ A more sophisticated algorithm using machine learning

## Stack

- Frontend framework: Svelte, React
- APIs: GitHub GraphQL
- Backend: Rust, NodeJS, Flask
- Runtime Environment: Docker
- ML Algorithm: Tensorflow
- Host: AWS, Raspberry Pi
- Database: PostgreSQL , MongoDB

## Demographic

The programming community, but more specifically those who are looking to improve themselves as developers and branch (no pun intended) out.
