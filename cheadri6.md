# The Pantry App
The general idea of the pantry app is a program that will allow you to track the inventory of your groceries and provide recipes based on the available ingredients the user has in their household. This program would differ from other similar apps, because it would be able to parse text from a picture of a receipt instead of requiring to scan a barcode individually for each grocery item. This program would also be able to deduct ingredients from your pantry list after you use the recipe listed in the app with a simple "cook" button.
