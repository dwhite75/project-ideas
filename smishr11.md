# Historical Information Map 
For this project, I'd like to build an app that helps people collect location information about their communities. The problem is, essentially, that there are a lot of streets and parks named after people that a) no one has ever heard of and b) have no information listed about them online. I used to leave school every day via a street called "D.B. Todd Boulevard". I still have no clue who D.B. Todd is. 

## Features
#### High Priority
- a web scraper for filling the map with existing historical information
- a map with pins on it where location data already is 
- a way for people to click and read on location information
- a submission tool so that people can add their own suggestions to locations

#### Low Priority
- a way for people to upvote/downvote submissions from other people 
- cryptid tracker

## Required Languages & Tools
- Google Maps/ArcGIS APIs
- Python

## Intended Customer
I think most people could benefit from this tool! I have zero interest in monetizing it because that would make people less inclined to contribute, especially people in lower income communities. As for our intended user base, I think people who are interested in geocaching (and maybe Pokemon Go..?)  may also be interested in this project. Maybe also older people and community leaders.
