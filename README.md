# Assignment 2

The goal of this assignment is to generate project ideas. Write a proposal for a project that might be used as your class group project. Write it as if you are pitching the idea to your company using an informal method like the phase 0 documents we talked about in class. Note that not all project ideas will become class projects just like not all project proposals in a company will be developed as products.

The proposal should be about 1/2 page â€“ 1 page in length and include:

- brief summary of the project idea
- what problem is being solved
- list of some of the major features
- what languages, tool sets, third-party code, etc you plan to use
- who would buy/use this solution

Submit the assignment by adding your proposal to the github repository https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22/project-ideas/ in a file named by your netid. The file should be in either .md format or pdf format. Push this file directly to the repository rather than using a pull request. The following steps show how to push directly to the repository:
1. git clone git@github.com:utk-cs340-spring22/project-ideas.git
2. git add netid.md (replace netid with your actual netid)
3. git commit -m "initial commit" netid.md
4. git push

You need to be a member of the class github page (utk-cs340-spring22) to push to that repository. You should have received an invitation to join by email. You can also go to https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22, it should show a box at the top that says you were invited you to join the utk-cs340-spring22 organization. There is a button that says "View Invitation". Click on that button and it will allow you to accept the invite and join the group.

Once you join, you can push to the project-ideas repository. If you did not get an invitation and can't see the invite at https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring22, send me an email at dreid6@vols.utk.edu with your github id and I'll add you.
