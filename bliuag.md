#Application for the study of Japanese kanji and other Chinese characters
There are a number of kanji studying applications currently available for 
students of Japanese, however, the majority of these are actually not well
optimized for their purpose. Many free options are either too simplified
or too complex for the simple purpose of memorization bombarding the user
with far too much information with readings and compounds. Memorization
techniques used in many applications are also questionable in their
effectiveness and efficiency.

To provide a more useful tool for language students, a more useful
application is ideal.
This application would provide a flashcard style character studying
system where the student is given a keyword meaning and a drawing
space by which they would attempt to write the character by hand.
On completion of their attempt they would then be shown a side-by-side
comparison of their drawing to the correct character.
A small animation may also be played by which the student may check
their stroke order for correctness.

Some other features of the studying application include...
-Customizable study sets where students may study character groups.
-An adjustable grading system by which students can gauge their
 learning progress.
-Custom "memo/comment" feature for individual flashcards allowing 
 students to work with their own mnemonic strategies.
-Hypothetical expansion to other Chinese characters in other
 languages.

Some tools immediately apparent to the project...
-"KanjiAlive" API, features a very cool animation library of the
 actual kanji writing and stroke order for the characters (in
 multiple formats to boot!)
-Javascript for API
-Swift or some other mobile development software (if decide
 to go mobile app route.)
